        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 15, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Kamil Pierudzki Oprogramowanie</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application, <strong>Change Background on Video</strong> (the "Application").</p>
        
        <p>Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not personally collect or store any personal data from our users. The Application is designed to be used without requiring you to provide any personal information such as your name, email address, location, or contacts. We do not require user registration.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services (Google AdMob)</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect data ourselves, the Application uses a third-party advertising service, <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, to display advertisements. Google AdMob is our partner for monetizing the Application, which allows us to offer it for free.</p>
        <p>Google AdMob may collect and use certain data to provide personalized or non-personalized ads. This data may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Such as your device's unique identifier (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address, operating system, and device model.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the ads shown in the Application (e.g., ads viewed, clicked, or interacted with).</li>
            <li><strong>General Location Data:</strong> Non-precise location data inferred from your IP address.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How Google uses this data is governed by Google's own Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review it to understand their data collection and usage practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy & Terms</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. User Consent (For Users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland)</h2>
        <p>In compliance with data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK to request your consent for the collection and use of your data for advertising purposes.</p>
        <p>When you first launch the Application, you will be presented with a consent screen that allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consent to personalized ads.</li>
            <li>Consent only to non-personalized ads.</li>
            <li>Decline consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can change your consent choice at any time within the Application's settings.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Although we do not collect personal data directly, we rely on the security measures implemented by our third-party partner, Google, to protect the data they collect.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
